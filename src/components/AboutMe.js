            <div><h1>Hi! I am Mayuresh Sawant.</h1>
    <p>I come from Mumbai, India where I also completed my Bachelors in Electronics Engineering back in 2018. Since then, I worked as an Agile Software Engineer with Tata Consultancy Services until early 2020. I developed Restful Java web apps for a banking client and worked extensively writing shell and Python scripts. After leaving my job at TCS, I worked as a Data Science fellow @ Fellowship.AI where I had a chance to work on some interesting Machine Learning problems with a group of very diverse and qualified group of individuals. I later worked as a Data Science intern @ Mibolsillo generating insights and developing hypothesis related to credit risk variables for the underbanked and unbanked.
